## Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project is built on Medallion Architecture, using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Holds raw data exactly as it comes from source systems. CSV files are loaded into the SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleans, standardizes, and normalizes the data to get it ready for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Stores business-ready data, structured in a star schema for reporting and analytics.
