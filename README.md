# The Ride Hub - Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## Project Background

Established in 2010, The Ride Hub has been a cornerstone of the cycling community, providing top-quality bicycles, accessories, and clothing to riders of all levels. Whether itâ€™s high-performance bikes, essential accessories, or stylish and functional apparel, the shop prides itself on delivering quality, innovation, and reliability. The business uses different operational systems for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). To create a unified view of the business, provide a single source of truth for reporting and analysis, data will be integrated and organized within a data warehouse. 

This project showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, from constructing a data warehouse to deriving actionable insights. It emphasizes industry best practices in data engineering and analytics, transforming raw data into valuable insights that support informed, data-driven decisions.

## Data Architecture & Data Flow Diagram

The data architecture for this project is built on **Medallion Architecture**, using **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Holds raw data exactly as it comes from source systems. CSV files are loaded into the SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleans, standardizes, and normalizes the data to get it ready for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Stores business-ready data, structured in a star schema for reporting and analytics.

The SQL queries for creating database called **DataWarehouse** and schemas for **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** can be found [here](scripts/database_and_schemas/create_database_and_schemas.sql)

## Data Structure & Data Type

The Ride Hub's database structure consists of three tables: **Sales**, **Customers** and **Products**. 

At the business level, the Gold Layer organizes data for effective analysis and reporting, featuring dimension tables and fact tables that define key business metrics.

In 2011, sales were **$7.1 million** and profits were relatively lower at **$2.8 million**. By 2013, total sales peaked at **$16.3 million**, with profits showing a significant increase to **$6.8 million**. The cost of sales rose alongside sales and profits illustrating the relationship between cost management and profit margins. The cost was **$4.3 million** in 2011 and **$9.6 million** in 2013.

### Customer Demographics

The dataset reveals a total of **18,000 customers** with a notable average order revenue of **$142K**. The average monthly revenue generated is **$1.9 million**. The gender distribution appears balanced, with **51% male** and **49% female**. The predominant age group of customers falls into the **50 and above category (73%)**, with only **26% between the ages of 40 and 49** and **1% between the ages of 30 and 39**. The data shows a predominance of older customers, which may influence marketing strategies and product offerings, necessitating a focus on products that resonate with this demographic. This near-even split indicates that marketing strategies should target both genders to maximize outreach.

### Customer Membership Types

The majority of customers are **new customers** at **79%**. The predominant share of new customers suggests a potential opportunity to convert more customers into **regular (12%)** or **VIP members (9%)**, which can enhance loyalty and increase revenue.
The minor percentage of VIP customers indicates potential for growth in loyalty programs. This portrays a healthy influx of new customers but also indicates a need for retention strategies.

## Recommendations

- **Regional Marketing Strategies**: Tailor marketing efforts based on regional sales performance to maximize impact, particularly in high-performing countries. Focus on expanding sales in countries like Germany and France, which show potential for growth.

- **Strengthening Product Offerings**: Given the high sales of mountain bikes, look into expanding its inventory in this category, potentially introducing new models or offering product customization options or accessories that complement biking experiences could prove lucrative. Consider promotions for Accessories and Clothing to balance the product portfolio.

- **Product Diversification**: Invest in product development, especially in Accessories and Clothing categories that show growth potential.

- **Cost Management**: Implement cost control measures to improve profit margins.

- **Enhance Customer Retention Initiatives**: The high percentage of new customers highlights the need for customer retention. Focus on converting New and Regular customers to VIP status through loyalty programs.

- **Targeted Marketing**: Given the demographic breakdown, focus marketing efforts toward the 50+ age group with tailored messages that resonate with their interests and lifestyle. Develop targeted marketing campaigns for different age segments, particularly younger customers, to capture market share that has been overlooked.

- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuous analysis of sales trends, customer feedback, and market conditions would help refine strategies for sustained growth.

## Assumptions and Caveats
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
- The collected data is complete and correct.
- According to the dataset, sales data for 2010 is available for December only and sales data for 2014 is available up to January only. Therefore, it has been assumed that the business was established in 2010 and business year remains in progress for 2014.
- Approximately 3% of the dataset contained missing or blank entries for country, year, and other fields. Additionally, some columns lacked any values. To ensure clarity, the data has been filtered appropriately in the report.
